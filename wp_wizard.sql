Over the last few WordPress releases, we&#8217;ve made a number of improvements to features like autosaves and revisions. With revisions, an old edit can always be restored. We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release. If we were able to rescue your draft, you&#8217;ll see it on the &#8220;All Posts&#8221; screen after you update to 3.8.3. (We&#8217;ll also be pushing 3.8.3 out as a background update, so you may just see a draft appear.)</p>\n<p>So, if you tried to jot down a quick idea last week, I hope WordPress has recovered it for you.

It&#8217;s possible some plugins that added stuff to the visual editor (like a new toolbar button) no longer work, so we&#8217;d like to hear about them (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">#24067</a>). (And be sure to <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">open a support thread</a> for the plugin author.)</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve added <strong>widget management to live previews</strong> (the customizer). Please test editing, adding, and rearranging widgets! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112">#27112</a>) We&#8217;ve also added the ability to upload, crop, and manage header images, without needing to leave the preview. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21785">#21785</a>)</li>\n<li>We brought 3.8&#8242;s beautiful new theme browsing experience to the <strong>theme installer</strong>. Check it out! (<a title="View ticket" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27055">#27055</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Galleries</strong> now receive a live preview in the editor. Upload some photos and insert a gallery to see this in action. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26959">#26959</a>)</li>\n<li>You can now <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> images directly onto the editor to upload them. It can be a bit finicky, so try it and help us work out the kinks. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19845">#19845</a>)</li>\n<li>Some things got improved around <strong>editing images</strong>. It&#8217;s a lot easier to make changes to an image after you insert it into a post (<a class="closed" title="View ticket" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24409">#24409</a>) and you no longer get kicked to a new window when you need to crop or rotate an image (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21811">#21811</a>).</li>\n<li>New <strong>audio/video playlists</strong>. Upload a few audio or video files to test these. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26631">#26631</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We&#8217;d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=3.9">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 3.9, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.9-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>DEVELOPERS!</strong> Hello! There&#8217;s lots for you, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Please test your plugins and themes!</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff under the hood in 3.9 and we hope to blog a bit about them in the coming days. If you haven&#8217;t been reading the awesome <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/">weekly summaries</a> on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">main core development blog</a>, that&#8217;s a great place to start. (You should definitely follow that blog.) For now, here are some things to watch out for when testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>load process in multisite</strong> got rewritten. If you notice any issues with your network, see <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27003">#27003</a>.</li>\n<li>We now use the <strong>MySQL Improved (mysqli) database extension</strong> if you&#8217;re running a recent version of PHP (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663">#21663</a>). Please test your plugins and see that everything works well, and please make sure you&#8217;re not calling <code>mysql_*</code> functions directly.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave</strong> was refactored, so if you see any issues related to autosaving, heartbeat, etc., let us know (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25272">#25272</a>).</li>\n<li>Library updates, in particular Backbone 1.1 and Underscore 1.6 (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26799">#26799</a>). Also Masonry 3 (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25351">#25351</a>), PHPMailer (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25560">#25560</a>), Plupload (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25663">#25663</a>), and TinyMCE (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">#24067</a>).</li>\n<li>TinyMCE 4.0 is a <em>major</em> update. Please see TinyMCE&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x">upgrade guide</a> and our <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067">implementation ticket</a> for more.

Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the spam and ham we detected each day:</p>\n<p><a href="https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/akismet-ham-stats-may-20141.png"><img src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/akismet-ham-stats-may-20141.png?w=640&h=400" alt="Akismet Spam and Ham Stats, May 2014" width="640" height="400" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1529" /></a></p>\n<p>There weren&#8217;t any big dips or highs during the month of May. The busiest day of the month was May 8, with just over <strong>230 million</strong> spam messages detected. The slowest day was May 25, with &#8216;only&#8217; about 178 million pieces of spam caught. You may have seen similar ups and downs in the spam activity on your own site.</p>\n<p>We had no service interruptions this month, so any fluctuations in spam numbers we attribute to the natural way spam is posted. If you want to hear about any service interruptions you can subscribe to this blog, or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/akismet">us on Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>As usual, there&#8217;s much more spam going around than real comments (which we call ham). You can see this by looking at the purple bars in the graph.</p>\n<p>Akismet detected a total of 294,312,590 real messages in May. If each real comment were a sugar cube, they&#8217;d only enough be enough to fill about 10% of one Olympic swimming pool.</p>\n<p>In May, we missed only about 1 in every 7,404 spam messages. If you&#8217;ve seeing lots of missed spam comments on your own site, we are happy to help with that, so feel free to <a href="http://akismet.com/contact/">contact us</a> about it, and please include your website &amp; your API key in your message.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Some reads from the month that we recommend:</strong><br />\nThis month, we rather enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/spam-always-finds-a-way/371194/">this piece</a> by Adrienne LaFrance about the history of spam (going back to snail mail!), and how it affects us nowadays. We also liked Seth Godin&#8217;s <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/04/what-is-spam.html">sage advice</a> (as always) on how not to spam people as a business, but still get business. In fact, in July <a href="http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2014/05/26/new-anti-spam-regulations-feature-tight-restrictions-hefty-fines/">Canada&#8217;s Anti-Spam legislation will come into effect</a> (<a href="http://www.techvibes.com/blog/a-guide-to-canadas-anti-spam-law-2014-05-20">similar to CAN-SPAM</a>), making the suggestions Seth Godin recommends, and even stricter rules around emailing, into law, which should make Canadians much happier with their inboxes <span class="wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile" title=":)">:)</span>.

It has just a handful of customization options built into the WordPress customizer, which means it will take less than a minute to make your site look like the demo.</p>\n<p>You can upload a logo image, set the navigation menu, add site title and tagline, and elect to use a static front page. Apart from those options, the design is set for you.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tracks-customizer.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23829]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tracks-customizer.jpg?resize=1025%2C587" alt="tracks-customizer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23841" /></a></p>\n<p>The only caveat with using this theme is that you&#8217;ll need to make sure you upload a large featured image for each post in order to keep the homepage looking colorful. The single posts page also uses that image for a panoramic display at the top of the content.</p>\n<p>The author bio section allows each author on the site to display links to social profiles after each post. This is configured in the &#8220;Edit Profile&#8221; page in the admin.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/author-profile.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23829]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/author-profile.jpg?resize=730%2C175" alt="author-profile" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23850" /></a></p>\n<p>Tracks is 100% responsive. If you resize the <a href="http://www.competethemes.com/tracks-live-demo" target="_blank">live demo</a> page, you&#8217;ll see that the content responds nicely to various screen sizes. It was designed to work well on well on desktops, tablets and phones. It uses fitvids.js to make sure that videos in your posts are also responsive to devices.</p>\n<p>The theme does not include any widget areas. As you can tell from the short list of options, Tracks is a design-specific theme focused on blog content and images. What you cannot see from the demo is that the theme is SEO-friendly with semantic link anchors and optimized title tags. It also incorporates ARIA-roles and follows basic accessibility guidelines.</p>\n<p>Tracks was created by <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/BenSibley/" target="_blank">Ben Sibley</a> and is available for free from WordPress.org. <a href="http://www.competethemes.com/documentation/tracks-knowledgebase/" target="_blank">Documentation</a> can be found on the author&#8217;s website and includes instructions for customizing the theme with a child theme.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 May 2014 23:13:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"WPTavern: Feuilles App Aims to Replace Editorially, Offers Publishing to Github, WordPress, and Dropbox";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23791";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:244:"http://wptavern.com/feuilles-app-aims-to-replace-editorially-offers-publishing-to-github-wordpress-and-dropbox?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feuilles-app-aims-to-replace-editorially-offers-publishing-to-github-wordpress-and-dropbox";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5076:"<p>Editorially closed its doors for good today, and with it goes all of the writing collaboration tools its users came to love.

It provides a markdown editor and a platform for discussing your texts with other people. If you have an Editorially export, you can import all of your documents into Feuilles and carry on writing.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Feuilles.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23791]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Feuilles.jpg?resize=962%2C509" alt="Feuilles" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23799" /></a></p>\n<p>Feuilles allows you to publish to Github, WordPress.com, and Dropbox, although the connections are still in the early/buggy stages, since the app is currently open to those interested in beta testing. It also works with Jetpack-enabled self-hosted WordPress sites.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/publish-Feuilles.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23791]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/publish-Feuilles.jpg?resize=727%2C377" alt="publish-Feuilles" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23800" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alexduloz" target="_blank">Alex Duloz</a> and his partner <a href="https://twitter.com/_KatyWatkins" target="_blank">Katy Watkins</a> used Editorially extensively in their work with <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/" target="_blank">The Pastry Box Project</a> while discussing texts and polishing their publishing skills. When Editorially announced that it was disappearing, they decided to create their own app but with a new twist: an emphasis on empowering people with a versatile API. Duloz explained the app&#8217;s purpose:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Feuilles is not Editorially. It&#8217;s a new project that sits on the shoulders of giants. My fanboy-ism took the latter form, the one of a homage. If you were used to working in Editorially, the previous sentence will immediately make sense when you start using Feuilles. There is a certain “feeling” that characterized Editorially which has been preserved in Feuilles (the way conversations work, how the dashboard allows you to interact with documents), but you will find that using our website to write is in fact not the real purpose of our website.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The power of Feuilles is in its <a href="https://feuill.es/documentation/api" target="_blank">API</a>; Duloz built the app for you to use with your own website. &#8220;Feuilles is here to provide publishers with <a href="https://feuill.es/documentation/api" target="_blank">a versatile API</a> (the same that we actually consume to operate) that they can use in their projects,&#8221; he said. <strong>&#8220;In fact, Feuilles is here so that you can launch collaborative blogs without even having to visit Feuilles. Our platform should just a be a means. Not an end.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>The API allows you to work through HTTP requests, so there&#8217;s no need to use the Feuilles app in order to work. They&#8217;ve opened a few of their endpoints for developers to experiment with to use Feuilles from remote HTTP locations. The &#8220;<a href="https://feuill.es/documentation/in-house-publishing" target="_blank">In-House Publishing</a>&#8221; feature makes it possible for you to post data from Feuilles to your own website by <a href="https://feuill.es/console/applications" target="_blank">registering an application</a>. Requests received to your website are POST requests and right now there isn&#8217;t a WordPress plugin to automate the In-House Publishing feature, so you&#8217;d have to dive into the technical details if you want to try it out.</p>\n<p>Duloz is aiming to make Feuilles a language/device agnostic CMS with In-House Publishing. As WordPress currently powers 22% of the web, it will be interesting to see how this app evolves to support people with self-hosted WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>Those who participate in collaborative writing are a rather small segment of overall WordPress users. However, if the popularity of Editorially is any indication, Feuilles may have the chance to become the web&#8217;s go-to application for writing collaboratively. Since its creators intend for it to be a means, not an end, its likely to enjoy a different trajectory than Editorially. Coming out of the gate with a strong focus on its API is a shrewd move that will enable the <a href="https://feuill.es/" target="_blank">Feuilles</a> app to be used in a multitude of different ways.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 May 2014 19:10:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"Andrew Nacin: Security is nuanced";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"http://nacin.com/?p=4235";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://nacin.com/2014/05/30/security-is-nuanced/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8171:"<p>As a software vendor, there are many reasons to prefer responsible disclosure of security issues. But the most important reason is also less obvious: vulnerability reports need to be <em>correct</em>.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen countless &#8220;full disclosure&#8221; reports that are wrong and invalid. Most of these could have been prevented by privately disclosing it to the vendor and allowing them the opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p>Everyone sees WordPress in the headlines, over and over again, but no one ever notices the &#8220;this report is invalid&#8221; response. We&#8217;ve prevented countless invalid reports from being published simply because they were disclosed to us first. This is better for the software&#8217;s users, who are otherwise left to scramble every time they see a report. They are not an expert, and often, neither is the reporter.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s another angle here, though: sometimes, the vulnerability report is correct, but <em>incomplete</em>. This too can send everyone scrambling, starting with the vendor who was not given the opportunity to straighten things out.</p>\n<p>When responsible disclosure works, it works really well. I offer <a href="http://jetpack.me/2014/04/10/jetpack-security-update/">Jetpack&#8217;s recent vulnerability</a> as a recent case study. While this was discovered internally at Automattic, the effect is the same: they were able to quickly and thoroughly investigate the issues and follow through with a plan of action. During their investigation they learned the problem was far more severe than they originally identified, and that their initial proposed fix was incomplete.</p>\n<p>There will always be individuals who want everything to be fully disclosed, and there are some great arguments for that. I&#8217;m not trying to sway you one way or the other. But if you&#8217;re trying to do the right thing — you&#8217;re doing full disclosure in the interest of users, possibly even providing a patch or steps to mitigate — working with the vendor is a good way to ensure you haven&#8217;t missed anything.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how many times now I&#8217;ve responded to a mailing list saying, &#8220;well, this isn&#8217;t a vulnerability,&#8221; or &#8220;your proposed patch is incomplete,&#8221; or &#8220;your patch makes it worse.&#8221; Or when I don&#8217;t respond to the mailing list because my thought is <em>T</em><em>his is worse than the reporter realizes.</em></p>\n<p>Security is nuanced.</p>\n<p>Last week, a security researcher disclosed some issues with WordPress. They stated that WordPress issues a cookie in plain HTTP that identifies the user. Correct. They also stated that this cookie does not expire when the user logs out. Also correct.</p>\n<p>She went on to state that the cookie has a lifetime of 3 years, that it can be used to mess with the account&#8217;s two-factor authentication settings, and change their email and other settings. She followed that up with &#8220;have notified them and waited 24hrs for response, none yet. guessing it&#8217;s a wontfix for now, since their SSL support is patchy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely, SSL support in WordPress is patchy. (Coincidentally, fixing all of this was already slated for the next major release.) While you can force SSL for the dashboard, we don&#8217;t have the concept of forcing SSL for the front-end of the site. So, that &#8220;logged in&#8221; cookie is issued over plain HTTP. It&#8217;s trivial in a plugin to force that cookie to be secure, but of course most users aren&#8217;t going to do that. Of course, most users also aren&#8217;t using SSL (sadly).</p>\n<p>WordPress also doesn&#8217;t have any concept of session management. The user is authenticated and a cookie is issued, but there&#8217;s no way for it to be automatically invalidated upon logout (without you changing your password). Changing this is a major architectural change we&#8217;ve been planning for some time. But this is also why cookies are designed with a limited expiration: just 48 hours, or 14 days if you click &#8220;Remember me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But the report was that it didn&#8217;t expire for three years, right? This is where it gets a bit weird. I&#8217;d love it if &#8220;Remember me&#8221; remembered you for 30, 90, or even 365 days, but WordPress will wait to make any changes until cookies can be invalidated. Some time ago, though, WordPress.com configured this cookie to last for three years.</p>\n<p>Normally, this wouldn&#8217;t be that bad. You see, the &#8220;logged in&#8221; cookie is <em>relatively</em> harmless. It allows presentational things like the toolbar, edit links in your theme, and such. But you can&#8217;t use it to manage your account, change your email, or do anything particularly crazy. In fact, WordPress issues a separate, secure &#8220;auth&#8221; cookie used for the &#8220;wp-admin&#8221; dashboard. It’s like Amazon knowing who you are after six months of not being on the site, but asking you to log in when you start to check out.</p>\n<p>On WordPress.com, however, a lot of settings can be managed outside of the dashboard, on their &#8220;new dashboard,&#8221; at wordpress.com/settings/. As you might have guessed by now, they were not requiring the &#8220;auth&#8221; cookie on this page, only the &#8220;logged in&#8221; cookie. That is the true critical vulnerability here. A number of decisions came together to make a latent issue a very real one. The issue wasn&#8217;t reported like this because the reporter isn&#8217;t familiar with the intricacies of user authentication internals in WordPress, nor should anyone expect them to. Rather, an assumption was made it was a design decision that would probably just be a &#8220;wontfix&#8221; due to &#8220;patchy&#8221; SSL support.</p>\n<p>The disclosure was well-intentioned, but because it happened within just 24 hours, Automattic wasn&#8217;t able to react quickly enough to identify the actual issue and request that it not be disclosed until they got a fix in place.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m just trying to set the record straight on what happened, since I keep seeing confused tweets, blog posts, comments, and Facebook chatter. (Favorite Facebook comment, after I posted a brief explanation: &#8220;Did we just open all those nesting doll layers to discover the belly was empty?&#8221;) This situation probably could have been handled better by everyone involved, but that&#8217;s not really the point. The primary issue is now handled, and other issues are also being addressed. I don&#8217;t think this requires post-mortem blog posts with a side of FUD. I&#8217;m not looking for a debate on full disclosure versus responsible disclosure. And I certainly don&#8217;t think anyone should be questioning the researcher, who has spent years dedicating herself to making the Internet more secure.</p>\n<p>In this case, WordPress.com the service was able to react quickly to mitigate this issue for all of its users. Of course, with software, holes can&#8217;t be closed so easily, and in this case, the situation was probably exacerbated by confusing WordPress.com the service with WordPress the software. That confusion is easy to understand, especially since some of these issues have roots in the core software.</p>\n<address>Security is nuanced.</address>\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve not linked to any previous posts because I don&#8217;t want this to be a criticism of any researcher or writer, but if you&#8217;re looking for background: <a href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/">1</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/05/unsafe-cookies-leave-wordpress-accounts-open-to-hijacking-2-factor-bypass/">2</a> <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-security-vulnerability-stirs-debate-over-responsible-disclosure">3</a>.

href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-recorder/" target="_blank">Query Recorder</a> is a new tool that allows developers to record queries while working in the WordPress admin. The plugin was created by Brad Touesnard, author of the popular <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-review-wp-db-migrate" target="_blank">WP Migrate DB</a> plugin. Touesnard introduced Query Recorder earlier this month at WordCamp Miami during his presentation on database deployment strategy.</p>\n<p>Once installed, the plugin allows you to create recordings that save queries run by your theme or plugins. The recordings are sent to a sql file located in your /uploads/ directory.</p>\n<p>The settings page gives you the option to set exclusions for certain types of queries and elect to omit or record queries that begin with insert, update, delete, drop, and create.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/query-recorder-settings.png" rel="prettyphoto[23767]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/query-recorder-settings.png?resize=1025%2C904" alt="query-recorder-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23773" /></a></p>\n<p>Clicking the button in the admin bar will start or stop the recording:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/start-stop-recording.png" rel="prettyphoto[23767]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/start-stop-recording.png?resize=1025%2C736" alt="start-stop-recording" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23774" /></a></p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve made a recording, open up the SQL file in your uploads folder and you&#8217;ll find your saved queries. In the example below you can see that I&#8217;ve enabled and disabled some plugins and themes.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/query-recorder.png" rel="prettyphoto[23767]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/query-recorder.png?resize=1025%2C447" alt="query-recorder" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23771" /></a></p>\n<p>Query Recorder can be particularly useful when working on a local installation of WordPress. You can record queries as you&#8217;re setting up a theme or plugin and create a SQL script that can be run later when deploying to another site. You can quickly test plugins and themes and then import the sql file when setting them up on a staging or live site.

In fact, the page hasn&#8217;t changed much since 2.7.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23752" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WordPress27PluginsPage.png" rel="prettyphoto[23671]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23752" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WordPress27PluginsPage.png?resize=831%2C537" alt="WordPress 2.7 Plugins Page" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress 2.7 Plugins Page</p></div>\n<p>However, that may change as Alex Shiels has proposed a <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/">detailed outline</a> explaining the improvements and changes he&#8217;d like to see. According to Shiels, the goal is to improve the experience for both new and experienced users.</p>\n<p>One of the suggested improvements is to have the plugin-install.php be the default page when selecting the Plugins menu in the backend of WordPress. I generally use the plugins page to activate or deactivate plugins for troubleshooting purposes. By making plugin-install.php the default page, it would require an extra step to browse to the installed plugins page.</p>\n<p>Instead, I&#8217;d rather the default page be left alone and enable the search box to find plugins within the directory. Other users <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/#comment-15346" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/#comment-15346">have chimed in</a> with similar feedback. As Shiels mentioned, &#8220;the Search Installed Plugins box on plugins.php is easily mistaken for a plugin directory search.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="attachment_23753" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PluginSearchBox.png" rel="prettyphoto[23671]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23753" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PluginSearchBox.png?resize=807%2C455" alt="Users Mistakenly Use The Search Box To Search The Plugin Directory" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Users Mistakenly Use The Search Box To Search The Plugin Directory</p></div>\n<p>I want the search engine for plugins to be improved. I&#8217;d also like to be able to organize search results by ratings, reviews, download count, etc. I&#8217;m happy to see the tag cloud may potentially be removed in favor of specific categories.</p>\n<p>Something I&#8217;d love to see is the ability to rate and review plugins from the backend of WordPress. This way, I wouldn&#8217;t have to visit each plugin&#8217;s page on the directory to give feedback. I&#8217;d also like to be able to access that information somehow on the Installed Plugins page.</p>\n<p>I think the Visit Plugin Site URL should link to the WordPress.org page listing for the plugin, not the author&#8217;s website. It would make it a lot easier to find the appropriate location to get support or view other data about the plugin on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>User Submitted Ideas</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of great ideas in the comments of the post. For instance, <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/#comment-15350" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/#comment-15350">Brad Tousnard suggested</a> a Plugin installation that uses AJAX to install plugins in-place instead of having to go through a series of steps or have separate browser tabs open to install multiple plugins.</p>\n<p>The plugin page doesn&#8217;t show whether or a not a plugin is dependent on another to work properly. Although there is a <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11308" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11308">four-year old trac ticket</a> that has a lengthy discussion about the topic, nothing concrete has been established. Once it&#8217;s out, the next step would be to create an easy way to see those dependencies when searching for plugins.</p>\n<h3>How to Get Involved</h3>\n<p>Since nearly everyone has experience managing plugins in WordPress, it&#8217;s no wonder the post is generating so much feedback. If you want to get involved with helping Shiels make improvements to the page, keep an eye on the <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/component/Plugins" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/component/Plugins">Plugins Component</a> on Trac.

It provides configuration management for WordPress database changes, similar to Drupal&#8217;s <a href="https://drupal.org/project/features" target="_blank">Features</a> module.</p>\n<p>WP-CFM lets you create and store bundles, which are essentially a group of one or more configuration options. The first step after installing the plugin is to create a /wp-content/config/ directory and grant write access.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/add-bundle.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23708]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/add-bundle.jpg?resize=967%2C339" alt="add-bundle" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23730" /></a></p>\n<p>WP-CFM provides a friendly interface for viewing the contents of the wp_options table so that you can select the options you want to be stored in a specific bundle. For example, let&#8217;s say that you want to grab all of your Jetpack options for deploying somewhere else. Create a Jetpack bundle:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/jetpack-bundle.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23708]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/jetpack-bundle.jpg?resize=892%2C530" alt="jetpack-bundle" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23733" /></a></p>\n<p>Each bundle has options for diff, push and pull:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>diff</strong> &#8211; comparison of database version vs the file version</li>\n<li><strong>push</strong> &#8211; write database changes to the file system</li>\n<li><strong>pull</strong> &#8211; import file changes in the database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Selecting &#8216;push&#8217; will store the database configuration in the file system (wp-content/config) as a .json file that you can then pull into your database at a later time or pull into another server.</p>\n<p>One very common example where WP-CFM would be helpful is in the case of widgets options. Step one is to create a widgets bundle:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/widget-options.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23708]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/widget-options.jpg?resize=818%2C380" alt="widget-options" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23737" /></a></p>\n<p>Next you would create a widgets diff:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/widgets-diff.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23708]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/widgets-diff.jpg?resize=966%2C390" alt="widgets-diff" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23738" /></a></p>\n<p>From here you can push those changes to the filesystem so they&#8217;re ready to deploy at another time. Most of the time when using WP-CFM, you&#8217;ll follow this basic workflow for storing and deploying configurations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make database changes</li>\n<li>Store them in configuration management</li>\n<li>Push the file to another server</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The &#8216;push&#8217; option on the All Bundles item writes all of your bundles to the file system at once, which is fairly handy. WP-CFM also includes developer hooks for registering custom configuration items, including a callback parameter for configuration data that is not stored within wp_options.</p>\n<p>Deploying bundles is really easy with WP-CFM&#8217;s support for WP-CLI, which enables you to pull or push bundles from the command line. Setting the bundle_name to &#8220;all&#8221; will push/pull all at once:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">wp config pull &lt;bundle_name&gt;\nwp config push &lt;bundle_name&gt;</pre>\n<h3>Benefits of using WP-CFM</h3>\n<p>WP-CFM can save you quite a bit of time when working alone but it really shines when working with team of multiple developers. In the docs, Gibbs identifies the benefits of including it in your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less need to copy the database. If you make changes, Push your bundle to the filesystem. To load changes, Pull the bundle into your database.</li>\n<li>No need to manually apply database settings changes. No more &#8220;fire drills&#8221; where you&#8217;re rushing to figure out which settings you forgot to change.</li>\n<li>Track and migrate configuration files using git, subversion, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WP-CFM is an excellent new tool for simplifying deployments and the best part is that it&#8217;s totally free. You can download it from <a href="https://github.com/forumone/wp-cfm" target="_blank">Github</a> or via the plugin&#8217;s <a href="http://forumone.github.io/wp-cfm/" target="_blank">homepage</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 May 2014 19:05:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: TeslaThemes Celebrates One Year Of Being In Business";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23669";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:168:"http://wptavern.com/teslathemes-celebrates-one-year-of-being-in-business?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=teslathemes-celebrates-one-year-of-being-in-business";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3971:"<p>When I <a title="http://wptavern.com/interview-with-brand-new-theme-club-teslathemes" href="http://wptavern.com/interview-with-brand-new-theme-club-teslathemes">discovered TeslaThemes last year</a>, their unique looking designs really impressed me. Since so many other theme shops have tried the theme club model and failed, I didn&#8217;t have much hope for them. However, the company is celebrating <a title="http://teslathemes.com/blog/celebrating-our-1st-year-anniversary-with-fantastic-offers/" href="http://teslathemes.com/blog/celebrating-our-1st-year-anniversary-with-fantastic-offers/">their first year</a> of being in business.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TeslaThemesFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[23669]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23716" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TeslaThemesFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200" alt="TeslaThemes Birthday Featured Image" /></a>The theme club model typically fails because it over promises and under delivers. The model is especially difficult for small 1-3 person businesses. While time is devoted to churning out new products, there also needs to be support in place for previously released items.</p>\n<p>TeslaThemes co-founder, Marcel Sobieski, told me they have released two new themes per month since launching the business while maintaining a customer satisfaction rating of 98% based on their monthly surveys. Sobieski says one of the greatest challenges the company faced is their rapid growth. &#8220;The greatest challenge TeslaThemes overcame in the first year is the fact that we are one of the fastest growing and healthy Premium WP Theme Clubs with a very strong community and stable workflow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company is part of the <a title="http://www.red-sky.com/" href="http://www.red-sky.com/">Red Sky group</a>, a Polish investment firm. &#8220;The financial perspective wasn&#8217;t the most important concern. This gave us the opportunity to focus purely on quality and roll out. At the moment, we are financially independent and have great plans ahead&#8221; Sobieski said. This is a luxury not many theme shops get to take advantage of.</p>\n<p>When asked what pivotal lessons were learned during the first year of business, Sobieski replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Quality. This is the essence of this business. There are thousands of WP themes on the market, many of them are free, many are ripped, many are stolen, but what a simple user or advanced design studio needs is actual quality. Before going live, every developer or designer must be sure they provide what the market needs plus something special, and not just duplicate existing and successful WP themes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With some WordPress commercial theme business owners discussing whether <a title="http://chriswallace.net/wordpress-themes-become-commodity/" href="http://chriswallace.net/wordpress-themes-become-commodity/">WordPress themes have become a commodity,</a> there is also the advice of concentrating on a specific niche. TeslaThemes plans on creating more themes to expand their catalog to cover more niches. If Chris Lema is right about <a title="http://chrislema.com/more-future-of-wordpress-themes/" href="http://chrislema.com/more-future-of-wordpress-themes/">theme purchasing patterns</a>, it will end up being a good strategy.</p>\n<p>For year number two, Sobieski says they&#8217;ll focus on co-operation with their customers while creating a 24/7 dedicated support channel. They&#8217;re also working on a new project called TeslaLab. TeslaLab is a dedicated paid customization center where customers can receive professional help with customizing their theme.</p>\n<p>So far, the company has proven that the club model can work but is it a sustainable model for long-term success? Only time will tell.</p>\n<p>Have you done business with TeslaThemes?

Ryan McCue and his team released <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-json-rest-api-version-1-0-released" target="_blank">version 1.0</a> over the weekend and have been pushing hard for it to be ready for the upcoming 4.0 release.</p>\n<p>When I spoke with McCue yesterday about the API&#8217;s readiness for 4.0, he said, &#8220;At this point, the API is considered feature complete. The upcoming 1.1 release is going to be heavily focused on testing and documentation, plus some general bug fixing as per usual. Moving forward, we&#8217;ll basically just be building out new features as needed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The discussion today resulted in an agreement to put the WP API project on the 4.1 roadmap, as it still hasn&#8217;t received the requisite testing and real-world exposure that core contributors would like to see before giving it the green light.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s &#8216;ready&#8217; for use, which is exciting,&#8221; Nacin said, when weighing in on the API during the meeting. <strong>&#8220;Now we just have to get it ready for the next five years and 22% of the internet.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Nacin suggested putting it squarely on the 4.1 roadmap with hopes of attracting more core contributors for the final mile. Although everyone is excited about having this new API in core, it&#8217;s an addition that all agreed is worthy of stronger core feedback before pushing it forward.</p>\n<h3>The WP API in the Wild</h3>\n<p>Meanwhile, more real-world examples of the API in use are popping up. <a href="https://twitter.com/ericandrewlewis" target="_blank">Eric Andrew Lewis</a>, a web developer for the New York Times, remarked, &#8220;We&#8217;re implementing it as of yesterday because it&#8217;s stable now.&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/kadamwhite" target="_blank">K. Adam White</a> also <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/25/json-rest-api-version-1-0/#comment-15415" target="_blank">commented</a> on the most recent make.wordpress.org update to report that his team is already making use of the API at <a href="http://bocoup.com/" target="_blank">Bocoup</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re using the API as the content backend for an in-development Node.js website and several single-page applications; nothing I can share publicly yet, but the API project was the tipping point that let me convince my colleagues that WordPress was a suitable backend for a non-PHP application. We’re really excited about the work we’re doing and I look forward to sharing it later in the year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although McCue feels that the API is ready for WordPress 4.0, those present at the development meeting agreed that more eyes and testers will help to ensure that the API enters core in a more robust state.</p>\n<h3>How WordPress Plugin and Theme Developers Can Help Test the WP API</h3>\n<div id="attachment_23698" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/building.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23676]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/building.jpg?resize=1024%2C526" alt="photo credit: shenamt - cc" class="size-full wp-image-23698" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shenamt/6906784503/">shenamt</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>WordPress developers are already doing some exciting things, such as creating plugins based on the API, i.e. the <a href="https://github.com/modemlooper/buddypress-json-api" target="_blank">BuddyPress JSON API</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-json-api" target="_blank">Pods JSON API</a> that emerged shortly after 1.0 was released. McCue believes that finding your own special interest is a good way to join in testing the API:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Contributing to a large project like WordPress core or the API isn&#8217;t always the easiest thing to do; these projects have certain rules and standards that can be annoying to have to deal with. The API is very much structured as the base for developers to build off, and it&#8217;s always much easier building with something you know, so I think finding something you&#8217;re familiar with and trying to integrate that with the API is a great way to both learn it, and help us test it out.</p></blockquote>\n<p>McCue is also keen to get WordPress theme developers testing the API with their projects, using the project&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/client-js" target="_blank">Javascript library</a>. <strong>&#8220;We&#8217;ve tried to design this so that even frontend developers with minimal knowledge of WordPress can go out and start creating, and those with WP knowledge can feel at home,&#8221;</strong> he said.</p>\n<p>During the development meeting McCue was asked about the advantages of theming with the API vs. calling the database through conventional (PHP) means. &#8220;You can do nice stuff like loading new content without a full page load,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And because of WP API’s internal reusability, you can also render it server side with practically the same code.&#8221; Others chimed in that lazy loading, AJAX calls, infinite scroll and the like will be much easier to implement with the new API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest effect I think the REST API will have is in opening up this data to other developers, including plugin and theme developers,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;We&#8217;re increasingly seeing more advanced front ends, including <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/collections/" target="_blank">Theme Foundry&#8217;s Collections</a> theme, P2 and the upcoming o2, and sites like <a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">Quartz</a>, and WP API will enable these sorts of sites to be built much quicker.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the past, these sorts of projects were extraordinarily unique endeavors that required a great deal of effort to build. With the JSON REST API finally added to WordPress core, the platform will be more open to unique use cases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The API will enable front end developers to build themes on WordPress without needing to know PHP or many of WP&#8217;s quirks,&#8221; McCue said. <strong>&#8220;I believe it will really open up WordPress as a framework that&#8217;s easily accessible to everyone.&#8221;</strong> As the project stands today, the team is working towards making improvements that will ensure the API&#8217;s readiness for WordPress 4.1. If you have feedback to add from working with version 1.0 or would like to contribute to the project, join the WP API Team Tuesdays in the #wordpress-dev channel on IRC at 00:00 UTC.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 May 2014 23:14:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: WordPress.com Security Vulnerability Stirs Debate Over Responsible Disclosure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23537";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:218:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-security-vulnerability-stirs-debate-over-responsible-disclosure?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-com-security-vulnerability-stirs-debate-over-responsible-disclosure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6809:"<p>Late last week, Yan Zhu, a Staff Technologist for the <a title="https://eff.org/" href="https://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation </a>publicly <a title="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/" href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/">disclosed</a> a security vulnerability she discovered with WordPress.com and how it handles cookies.

Within 24 hours of notifying Automattic, Zhu publicly disclosed the vulnerability on her blog. The information was picked up by <a title="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/05/unsafe-cookies-leave-wordpress-accounts-open-to-hijacking-2-factor-bypass/" href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/05/unsafe-cookies-leave-wordpress-accounts-open-to-hijacking-2-factor-bypass/">Ars Technica</a> resulting in millions of readers finding out about the security issue before a fix was available. What was once a good deed is now an example of irresponsible disclosure.</p>\n<p>According to Wikipedia, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">responsible disclosure</a> is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A <a title="Computer security" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security">computer security</a> term describing a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Vulnerability disclosure" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_disclosure">vulnerability disclosure</a> model. It is like <a title="Full disclosure (computer security)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29">full disclosure</a>, with the addition that all stakeholders agree to allow a period of time for the <a title="Vulnerability (computing)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_%28computing%29">vulnerability</a> to be <a title="Patch (computing)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_%28computing%29">patched</a> before publishing the details. Developers of hardware and software often require time and resources to repair their mistakes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When <a title="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/#comment-70" href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/#comment-70">asked</a> why she didn&#8217;t give Automattic more time, Zhu responded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, in this case, I believe that 24hrs was a fair amount of time. The main reason is that SSL support nowadays is widely accepted as the bare *minimum* security guarantee that a website should provide for users’ private information, and this is essentially a bug in WordPress’s SSL support. “Only send auth info over SSL” has been the most basic security recommendation to website operators for the last 15+ years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although <a title="http://automattic.com/security/" href="http://automattic.com/security/">Automattic states</a> they&#8217;ll try to contact the reporter within 24 hours, I&#8217;d give them at least 72. The WordPress core handbook states that <strong>in all cases, you should not publish the details</strong>. The Automattic submission form states, &#8220;If you happen to find a <strong>security vulnerability</strong> in one of our services, we would appreciate letting us know before disclosing the issue publicly.&#8221; Perhaps the Automattic submission form should also request that reporters not publish the details.</p>\n<h3>When Disclosure Becomes Irresponsible</h3>\n<p>Any time a security vulnerability is disclosed before it&#8217;s fixed within a reasonable time frame, it&#8217;s irresponsible disclosure. Of course, what is a reasonable time frame is subjective but common sense dictates at least 3-5 days to hear a response back. Besides, they have to verify and duplicate the report in order to come up with a fix. Even if the issue is already known to attackers or is easy to find, it doesn&#8217;t make it <strong>ok</strong> to publicize it through the media. These types of actions fan the flames and make the reporter look like the bad person.</p>\n<p>When it comes to how long of a time frame is acceptable before going to the public, everyone likely has a different answer. It also depends on what has gone on behind the scenes. For instance, when was it reported and when did the company respond back? Did they promise a fix but haven&#8217;t released it in months? In rare instances, publicizing a vulnerability is the only way to get a company to act but should be treated as the nuclear option.</p>\n<p>In the comments of Zhu&#8217;s article, <a title="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/#comment-106" href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/#comment-106">Matt Mullenweg thanked her</a> for the report with a request that she allow more time for Automattic to act.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thank you very much for finding and investigating this problem. If there’s a next time, I would definitely appreciate it if you gave us a few days more next time to protect users before it’s public.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Do you think Zhu is in the wrong for publishing details of the security issue too soon or was 24 hours enough time for Automattic to implement a fix? If you discovered a security vulnerability and reported it to the vendor, what would need to happen to convince you that publicizing is the only way to get it fixed?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 May 2014 19:46:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Matt: New Socket.IO 1.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=43826";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-socket-io-1-0/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:225:"<p><a href="http://socket.io/blog/introducing-socket-io-1-0/#credits">Socket.IO 1.0 is available</a> with a number of new features, including binary support.

It ran earlier this month with four days (Thursday &#8211; Sunday) packed full of activities. Multiple venues, parking areas, presentation tracks, catering and food vendors can all add to the likelihood of unexpected delays or changes in schedule.</p>\n<p>How do you keep that many people informed with updates? Text alerts were the glue that kept everyone together on the same page, according to organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/" target="_blank">David Bisset</a>. WordCamp Miami utilized <a href="https://gather.mailchimpapp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp&#8217;s Gather service</a> to shoot out reminders and changes of schedule.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gather-text-update.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[22934]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gather-text-update.jpg?resize=296%2C516" alt="gather-text-update" class="alignright size-full wp-image-23647" /></a>Many WordCamps use MailChimp to organize event emails. The Gather app allows you to text message your MailChimp email subscribers to keep them updated throughout the event. Subscribers can respond to organizers individually with no app or setup required. For example, if you want to alert everyone where parking is located, you can send a quick text in the morning. Attendees can also alert you to any problems.</p>\n<p>When you set up a new event with Gather, it gives you a customizable signup form that you can share via Twitter, email or your MailChimp account. It also gives you a phone number to use that is separate from your personal number, so you can retain your privacy. The organizer never has access to subscribers&#8217; phone numbers and the service automatically deletes the numbers after the event expires.</p>\n<p>Pricing is a nominal fee that you pre-pay for bundles of text messages, depending on the size of your event: 175 messages for $8.99, 500 messages for $18.99, or 2000 messages for $48.99. This includes your new Gather phone number.</p>\n<h3>Getting Attendees to Sign Up For Text Alerts</h3>\n<p>Getting people to sign up for text alerts may not be the easiest task, as nobody wants to open up their phone to a flood of unimportant messages or info that&#8217;s already printed in the schedule.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to assure your subscribers that you&#8217;re not going to overload them with texts. Make sure they know their numbers will be deleted after the event and that you&#8217;ll send only the important stuff. WordCamp Miami did a good job of this on its text alerts signup page:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will keep the notifications to a minimum. They will involve any last-minute session/room changes, after party information, and emergency information.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bisset had three separate text message channels for the event, including one for general attendees, volunteer corps, and WordCamp organizers. He said that it kept their team from having to run around and holler at each other for help during the event.</p>\n<p>As an attendee and speaker at WordCamp Miami, I can attest to the fact that these text message alerts kept everything running like a well-oiled machine. I would highly recommend them to any organizer who is looking to improve the overall event experience for attendees and volunteers.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 May 2014 19:08:24

Reading through that <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changelog/0.70" target="_blank">changelog</a> will make you smile and realize how far the software has come since the early days when its main competitors were <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/" target="_blank">Textpattern</a> and <a href="http://movabletype.org/" target="_blank">Movable Type</a>.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 11 years and WordPress now powers <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">22% of the web</a> with a content management system market share of 60.0%. Many moons ago, when you were hacking <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/default" target="_blank">Kubrick</a>, did you ever imagine that you&#8217;d see WordPress <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-featured-in-apples-new-ipad-advertising-campaign" target="_blank">featured in an Apple product advertisement</a>? Could you have predicted that WordPress would power major news publications and government sites around the globe?</p>\n<p>Over the past decade, this open source platform has enabled people to build creative, thriving businesses that support their families and improve the lives of others in small and big ways. With more than 31,000 free <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">plugins</a> and 665 million plugin downloads, WordPress&#8217; extensibility makes it possible for the platform to power nearly any kind of website, from major corporations to universities to social networks. Best of all, WordPress has helped ordinary people tell their stories and find a voice in the world.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to the people who build WordPress, the ever-growing community that supports it, and the users who choose to publish with it every day. Happy birthday and congratulations on 11 years burning brighter.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 May 2014 05:00:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: WordPress for iOS Featured in Apple’s New iPad Advertising Campaign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23507";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:196:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-featured-in-apples-new-ipad-advertising-campaign?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-for-ios-featured-in-apples-new-ipad-advertising-campaign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2437:"<p>Apple has a new advertisement for iPad, featuring Chérie King, whose WordPress-powered <a href="http://flightofthetravelbee.com/" target="_blank">Flight of the Travel Bee</a> blog is dedicated to helping deaf people discover the joy of traveling.</p>\n<p>Her story can be found at <a href="http://www.apple.com/cherie" target="_blank">apple.com/cherie</a> and is included as part of the &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/your-verse/" target="_blank">What will your verse be?</a>&#8221; campaign.

The survey was conducted between March 7 – April 11, 2014. 183 people from 37 countries participated.

Out of those who have contributed to the project, only 7% have written articles for the Codex.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23562" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ContributedTobbPress.png" rel="prettyphoto[23441]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23562" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ContributedTobbPress.png?resize=592%2C823" alt="bbPress Codex Articles Are Hard To Come By" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">bbPress Codex Articles Are Hard To Come By</p></div>\n<p>It probably doesn&#8217;t help that in order to log into the bbPress.org website, you need to log into BuddyPress.org first. Then after you login, you&#8217;re not redirected to bbPress.org, you&#8217;re stuck on BuddyPress.org. If newcomers are looking to contribute to the Codex, you won&#8217;t be able to learn how because the <a title="http://codex.bbpress.org/participate-and-contribute/codex-standards-guidelines/" href="http://codex.bbpress.org/participate-and-contribute/codex-standards-guidelines/">Codex Standards and Guidelines</a> document links to a 404 error page.</p>\n<p>When asked what are the strengths of bbPress, the top four answers are what I&#8217;d expect.

In fact, it&#8217;s the same set of complaints I&#8217;ve read and heard over the past few years. It lacks features out of the box compared to other forum software which leads to using several plugins just to bring it up to par. What surprises me most is that 54% said they were not sure about the future of the plugin.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23566" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bbPressUncertainFuture.png" rel="prettyphoto[23441]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23566" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bbPressUncertainFuture.png?resize=581%2C375" alt="Uncertain Of The Future Of bbPress" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Uncertain Of The Future Of bbPress</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s been <a title="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2463" href="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2463">four years</a> since bbPress switched from being a stand alone piece of software to a WordPress plugin. There was <a title="http://bbpress.org/forums/topic/bbpress-plugin-is-born/" href="http://bbpress.org/forums/topic/bbpress-plugin-is-born/">a lot of uncertainty</a> about the project around the time of the switch but that was four years ago. I&#8217;m curious as to why 54% of respondents are not sure about the future of the plugin. In those four years, John James Jacoby, Stephen Edgar, and several other contributors have made substantial improvements to the plugin. How could those improvements lead to uncertainty?</p>\n<p>The requested improvements and new features list are similar to the list of most popular bbPress plugins activated. While attachments took the top spot with 42%, most of the votes were evenly distributed. This leads me to believe users would like to see every feature in the list added to bbPress. Take a look at the list of features and tell me which are not already available in most forum software.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23567" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TopRequestedItems.png" rel="prettyphoto[23441]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23567" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TopRequestedItems.png?resize=482%2C621" alt="Top Requested bbPress Features" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Top Requested bbPress Features</p></div>\n<p>88% of respondents said they evaluated other forum software before deciding on bbPress. Of those evaluated, phpBB took the top spot with 72%. The SimplePress plugin took second place with 44%. Despite its lack of features out of the box, bbPress was chosen by many of the respondents over other popular forum software. Considering the price tag on vBulletin, I was surprised it ranked so high.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23568" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OtherForumSoftwareEvaluated.png" rel="prettyphoto[23441]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23568" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OtherForumSoftwareEvaluated.png?resize=579%2C369" alt="Other Forum Software Evaluated" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Other Forum Software Evaluated</p></div>\n<h3>bbPress Has Come A Long Way But Has So Much Further To Go</h3>\n<p>In 2009, I <a title="http://wptavern.com/why-i-use-vbulletin" href="http://wptavern.com/why-i-use-vbulletin">explained why</a> I chose vBulletin over bbPress to power the WP Tavern forum. Many of the reasons in that post are still valid arguments for why I&#8217;d probably not use bbPress today. It makes me sad to see so many huge walls in front of the bbPress project. As an end-user, the lack of features in bbPress is a detriment, not a feature itself. The code that makes up bbPress is some of the best you&#8217;ll see in a WordPress plugin but great code doesn&#8217;t equate to mainstream use.</p>\n<p>bbPress has a lot going for it. It&#8217;s a WordPress plugin so it works with WordPress as if they are one entity and being a plugin, it&#8217;s simple to install. The default theme compatibility enables it to blend in with just about every WordPress theme. It&#8217;s free, open source, and considered an official plugin and there&#8217;s a passionate community supporting it.</p>\n<p>If bbPress is ever going to be on par with other forum solutions, it&#8217;s going to have to pack more punch into its default feature set. I&#8217;m not the only who thinks so. Take this survey comment for example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Needs a lot more focus on adding front end features both for users and mods/admins. There is a serious lack of traditional forum features that people expect to have, and it really holds bbPress back.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think users would love to have something that suits most of their needs out of the box and then add plugins for additional functionality. Unfortunately, bbPress requires several plugins to be installed before it can even be considered on par with its competition.</p>\n<h3>Will bbPress Ever Be Mainstream?</h3>\n<p>There are other forces at work besides what is going on internally with bbPress. The nature of social interaction on the web is radically different from 10 years ago. Forums were like watering holes for specific topics with like-minded individuals. Today, most of the conversation happens on one or more social networks. There is also an <a title="http://www.businessesgrow.com/2014/03/26/eliminating-comments/" href="http://www.businessesgrow.com/2014/03/26/eliminating-comments/">ongoing trend</a> of large websites turning comments off.</p>\n<p>One of the <a title="http://bbpress.org/blog/2013/11/bbpress-2-5-released/" href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2013/11/bbpress-2-5-released/">signature features of bbPress 2.6</a> will replace WordPress comments with bbPress topics. You&#8217;ll be able to replace your comment form with bbPress and merge together community conversations that forums provide with directed topics of conversation via the blog. It&#8217;s a marriage of functionality I&#8217;ve been wanting for years but it might be too little too late.</p>\n<p>Will this feature spark a renaissance of forums, community, and on site conversations or has managing such things become too much work? Will we ever see the day when the percentage of sites using bbPress is as closely monitored as that of sites using WordPress?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 May 2014 23:00:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WPTavern: WordPress JSON REST API Version 1.0 Released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23496";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:152:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-json-rest-api-version-1-0-released?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-json-rest-api-version-1-0-released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4946:"<p>Version 1.0 of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/" target="_blank">JSON REST API plugin</a> was <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/25/json-rest-api-version-1-0/" target="_blank">released</a> over the weekend, adding new user, revision and post meta endpoints. This release also introduces the project&#8217;s new long-term backwards compatibility policy for its internal PHP API and REST API, which will not be broken from this point forward as new endpoints and data are added.</p>\n<p>The WP API project is led by <a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue" target="_blank">Ryan McCue</a>, who said that the team is pushing hard for integration into WordPress 4.0, although it is not yet guaranteed. McCue published an <a href="https://gist.github.com/rmccue/722769379f4fc4148b1f" target="_blank">integration plan</a> for getting the WP API into core for the 4.0 merge window, if the project receives the green light.</p>\n<h4>Understanding the Benefits of the JSON REST API</h4>\n<p>McCue&#8217;s proposal highlights the need for an alternative to the XML-RPC API that is currently provided in core and demonstrates how the JSON REST API provides a superior solution for allowing remote access to data.</p>\n<p>Because the WP API was designed from the ground up for integration into WordPress, it follows WP coding standards and will enter the core with full translatability. The WP API is being built to eventually include every data type found in WordPress, including post types and their metadata. It&#8217;s also built with extensibility in mind for themes and plugins and makes liberal use of actions and filters.</p>\n<p>In addition to the huge benefit of the API being built <strong>FOR</strong> WordPress, McCue sites several other distinct benefits to its inclusion in core, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data serialization uses the JSON standard, which maps more directly to common data structures in most programming languages.</li>\n<li>Communication with the API uses the HTTP 1.1 standard, available in almost every programming language. Representational State Transfer (&#8220;REST&#8221;) semantics are used for interaction, which are available in the majority of HTTP clients, and compatibility is provided for those without this ability.</li>\n<li>The data serialization layer is independent of the data manipulation and accessing layer, enabling the JSON or HTTP semantics to be replaced with another protocol, (i.e. MessagePack or Cap&#8217;n Proto.)</li>\n<li>The internal structure of the API allows use by regular PHP code. This enables using the data layer of the API for other uses, such as a future version of WP-CLI or internal form handlers.</li>\n</li>\n<li>The API relies on no external services. It includes methods for automatically locating the API given only a WordPress site address, as well as programatically assessing the availability of parts of the API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>WordPress Developers are Already Building API Plugins</h4>\n<p>This API constitutes a monolithic addition to the WordPress codebase but it opens up a whole new world for developers who are extending the platform to access information remotely. Shortly after version 1.0 was released, a few WordPress developers reported back about making use of the API in their projects.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bp-json-api.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23496]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bp-json-api.jpg?resize=226%2C219" alt="bp-json-api" class="alignright size-full wp-image-23526" /></a>Ryan Fugate (@modemlooper), took the initiative to add <a href="https://github.com/modemlooper/buddypress-json-api" target="_blank">BuddyPress JSON API</a> endpoints. When Scott Kingsley Clark saw the starter scaffolding for the BuddyPress API, he was inspired to build a <a href="https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-json-api" target="_blank">Pods JSON API</a> for his <a href="http://pods.io/" target="_blank">Pods Framework</a> in just a few short hours.</p>\n<p>McCue and his team of contributors are now starting on a documentation and testing push to prepare the plugin for possible inclusion into WordPress 4.0. A documentation site is now up at <a href="http://wp-api.github.io/" target="_blank">wp-api.github.io</a>. These docs are very much in transition as the project moves forward and will eventually include the <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/master/docs/guides" target="_blank">guides</a> and master <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">docs</a> which are in different places right now.

Make is a free, drag and drop theme that makes it easy to manipulate the design of pages. In the interview, Strojny explains why Make is available for free and why the page building aspect of the theme was not put into its own plugin.

By activating Hide Plugins, you will be able to see all plugins and a toggle to hide each plugin from other users on the Plugins page. Hide Plugins will always remain hidden.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-color-on-word-count/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-color-on-word-count/">Editor Color</a> on Word Count automatically changes the color of the content editor based on the number of words written.

(1814, 1, '2014-06-02 10:31:35', '2014-06-02 10:31:35', 'Ok, so this is my first post… What better way to begin than discussing two of my favourite topics. Cycling, technology, specifically cycling technology. I might just blog about technology, but the truth is I find the useful application of technology much more exciting!\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_1873" align="alignnone" width="1100"]<a href="http://wizard.technology/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Test-on-Bike-cr.jpg"><img src="http://wizard.technology/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Test-on-Bike-cr.jpg" alt="Test on bike" width="1100" height="600" class="grayed size-full wp-image-1873" /></a> Source: http://www.vo2test.com/assets/Test-on-Bike.jpg[/caption]\r\n\r\nThose of you who know me are well aware of my tendency to go on a bit about my cycling – I’m not the type of cyclist who rides through red lights or is aggressive towards other road users – no – I’m the sort who believes that every road user has the right to be there and wants to go about their business whatever it might be. That’s just a bit of background – the new breed of cyclist, of which there seem to be millions is perhaps the subject of another post… I’ve always been a cyclist (apart from an eight year break straight after I attended training camp in Majorca [that’s just how sore I was!]), and like most of my peers – and I’ve always wanted anything that will make me go faster. Ever since BBC’s ‘Tomorrows World’ I’ve always been very interested about any kind of bleeding edge technology. I purchased a set of Tri-Bars the weekend after they were deemed legal by the CTT or RTTC as it was then. Cyclists are suckers for shiny new bits that bring promise of going faster than their competitors (this often includes their riding partners – if they have a competitive streak like myself).\r\n\r\nBack then only [sport] scientists with access to expensive monitoring equipment, but recently the cost of measuring equipment, specifically power meters (roughly speaking a device that measures the force applied to the pedals, and multiplies it by the angular velocity to arrive at a figure described in Watts)  has dropped to a price which falls within the budget of many amateur cyclists, and can be fitted to the bicycle itself rather than being restricted to the lab. \r\n\r\nSome may say I’m boring, but ever since college I’ve been interested in data – not just data, but how to build information from data. Data is (or ‘are’ if we are talking plural units) normally fairly meaningless to the naked eye, it’s how we format it that transforms it into useful information. Cycling is one of the few sports where we can gather so much useful data – the bicycle is an extremely efficient machine where many measurements can be taken in addition to the standard metrics such as heart rate which can be measured in many other endurance sports.  There are many desktop and web-based programs out there which allow the cyclist to view various metrics in a graphical format. These are highly useful for post race analysis, or monitoring training loads etc. Some have highly useable, convenient, social web-based interfaces but don’t show enough data (Strava), others have ugly interfaces with poor user experience, but are much better at showing performance trends (WKO+). The result is usually that rides have to be uploaded to several systems. \r\n\r\nBut the question is do any of systems help the average user? Top time triallist and author  Michael Hutchinson’s book Faster: The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World''s Fastest Cyclists  describes how the success of the British Cycling Team was partly founded on the use  technology – coaches using vast amounts of historical data to produce training plans for their athletes. This is where I think where the data recorded is particularly useful. It’s interpretation. I think the recent results on the track speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nI have been using a power meter for over 18 months now, in which time I have become slower and slower in my races. In 2012 my target was to go under the hour for a 25 Mile time trial, something I had spent the whole winter training for – using some rollers (basically a treadmill for a bike) trying to spin a bigger and bigger gear, and doing some MTB and club road rides. As I’d injured myself late 2011 season, I’d had to start gingerly, so had to rapidly gain fitness in time for the start of my racing season in March. It was all very unscientific, but the long and short of it was that by June, on a wet and windy day I managed to do a 59:32, achieving my target. Unfortunately, I have no idea what power I’d produced on that day as I didn’t take delivery of my first power meter until Jan 2013. With all the live monitoring and analysis that a power meter provides 2013 was a much slower year, I’d also read many books by respected authors on the subject too – late 2013 I’d decided to ignore all I’d read and go back to training by  feel, but using a power meter to measure for improvement.\r\n\r\n2014  began ok again but by May I seemed to be finishing well further back than I know I’m capable of – I’m only 2 Watts behind my best performance of 2013, but feeling a bit fed up. Recently at my local cycling club’s  (Minehead CC) first of the year’s hill climb series, We had a debate whether technology actually helps. One of the club’s members does not subscribe to the hi-tech route – rather than ‘All the gear, no idea’ it’s ‘None of the gear, definitely doing something right’, as he frequently rides much, much faster than his lycra’d up counterparts – I love to see this, unless, it is me he is overtaking of course! He is a farmer who admits to like eating greasy food, but for whatever reason, he is incredibly fast, and a top bloke too! His training consists of a greasy fry up and going out for a ride to enjoy himself… I can’t help but think what he would be like if incorporated high-tech cycling into his world – perhaps he would just give up due to the boredom of spending hundreds of hours riding a stationary bike though the winter.\r\n\r\nAttending races frequently, I still feel the hi-tech route is the way to go, but the danger is not knowing how to interpret the information, despite having over 20years of competitive riding experience (in fits and starts) – I’m still failing at this. I also feel training without any formal coaching is bad too – many top coaches insist that their athletes own and use a power meter. A self-coached athlete is a danger to themselves. Recently I’ve started to use TrainerRoad software which is like being coached in a way, but does not take into account individual strengths and weaknesses, but at least this formalised high tech training is guaranteed to bring improved results. \r\nMy take on it is that the cyclist should be able to look for patterns in their training and race data that lead up to their best performances, rather than relying on rule or algorithm based analysis. We’re going to be creating an online app that allows the user to do this. No details yet, but harnessing the power of HTML5 we’re going to be filling in the gaps left my other applications.  A good place to look is the feature request boards – It seems as if I am one of the frustrated many who have specific common requests that just don’t get implemented.

Data is (or ‘are’ if we are talking plural units) normally fairly meaningless to the naked eye, it’s how we format it that transforms it into useful information. Cycling is one of the few sports where we can gather so much useful data – the bicycle is an extremely efficient machine where many measurements can be taken in addition to the standard metrics such as heart rate which can be measured in many other endurance sports.  There are many desktop and web-based programs out there which allow the cyclist to view various metrics in a graphical format. These are highly useful for post race analysis, or monitoring training loads etc. Some have highly useable, convenient, social web-based interfaces but don’t show enough data (Strava), others have ugly interfaces with poor user experience, but are much better at showing performance trends (WKO+).

Top time triallist and author  Michael Hutchinson’s book Faster: The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World''s Fastest Cyclists  describes how the success of the British Cycling Team was partly founded on the use  technology – coaches using vast amounts of historical data to produce training plans for their athletes.

In 2012 my target was to go under the hour for a 25 Mile time trial, something I had spent the whole winter training for – using some rollers (basically a treadmill for a bike) trying to spin a bigger and bigger gear, and doing some MTB and club road rides. As I’d injured myself late 2011 season, I’d had to start gingerly, so had to rapidly gain fitness in time for the start of my racing season in March. It was all very unscientific, but the long and short of it was that by June, on a wet and windy day I managed to do a 59:32, achieving my target. Unfortunately, I have no idea what power I’d produced on that day as I didn’t take delivery of my first power meter until Jan 2013. With all the live monitoring and analysis that a power meter provides 2013 was a much slower year, I’d also read many books by respected authors on the subject too – late 2013 I’d decided to ignore all I’d read and go back to training by  feel, but using a power meter to measure for improvement.\r\n\r\n2014  began ok again but by May I seemed to be finishing well further back than I know I’m capable of – I’m only 2 Watts behind my best performance of 2013, but feeling a bit fed up. Recently at my local cycling club’s  (Minehead CC) first of the year’s hill climb series, We had a debate whether technology actually helps. One of the club’s members does not subscribe to the hi-tech route – rather than ‘All the gear, no idea’ it’s ‘None of the gear, definitely doing something right’, as he frequently rides much, much faster than his lycra’d up counterparts – I love to see this, unless, it is me he is overtaking of course! He is a farmer who admits to like eating greasy food, but for whatever reason, he is incredibly fast, and a top bloke too! His training consists of a greasy fry up and going out for a ride to enjoy himself… I can’t help but think what he would be like if incorporated high-tech cycling into his world – perhaps he would just give up due to the boredom of spending hundreds of hours riding a stationary bike though the winter.\r\n\r\nAttending races frequently, I still feel the hi-tech route is the way to go, but the danger is not knowing how to interpret the information, despite having over 20years of competitive riding experience (in fits and starts) – I’m still failing at this. I also feel training without any formal coaching is bad too – many top coaches insist that their athletes own and use a power meter. A self-coached athlete is a danger to themselves. Recently I’ve started to use TrainerRoad software which is like being coached in a way, but does not take into account individual strengths and weaknesses, but at least this formalised high tech training is guaranteed to bring improved results. \r\nMy take on it is that the cyclist should be able to look for patterns in their training and race data that lead up to their best performances, rather than relying on rule or algorithm based analysis.

Data is (or ‘are’ if we are talking plural units) normally fairly meaningless to the naked eye, it’s how we format it that transforms it into useful information. Cycling is one of the few sports where we can gather so much useful data – the bicycle is an extremely efficient machine where many measurements can be taken in addition to the standard metrics such as heart rate which can be measured in many other endurance sports.  There are many desktop and web-based programs out there which allow the cyclist to view various metrics in a graphical format. These are highly useful for post race analysis, or monitoring training loads etc. Some have highly useable, convenient, social web-based interfaces but don’t show enough data (Strava), others have ugly interfaces with poor user experience, but are much better at showing performance trends (WKO+).

In 2012 my target was to go under the hour for a 25 Mile time trial, something I had spent the whole winter training for – using some rollers (basically a treadmill for a bike) trying to spin a bigger and bigger gear, and doing some MTB and club road rides. As I’d injured myself late 2011 season, I’d had to start gingerly, so had to rapidly gain fitness in time for the start of my racing season in March. It was all very unscientific, but the long and short of it was that by June, on a wet and windy day I managed to do a 59:32, achieving my target. Unfortunately, I have no idea what power I’d produced on that day as I didn’t take delivery of my first power meter until Jan 2013. With all the live monitoring and analysis that a power meter provides 2013 was a much slower year, I’d also read many books by respected authors on the subject too – late 2013 I’d decided to ignore all I’d read and go back to training by  feel, but using a power meter to measure for improvement.\r\n\r\n2014  began ok again but by May I seemed to be finishing well further back than I know I’m capable of – I’m only 2 Watts behind my best performance of 2013, but feeling a bit fed up.

One of the club’s members does not subscribe to the hi-tech route – rather than ‘All the gear, no idea’ it’s ‘None of the gear, definitely doing something right’, as he frequently rides much, much faster than his lycra’d up counterparts – I love to see this, unless, it is me he is overtaking of course! He is a farmer who admits to like eating greasy food, but for whatever reason, he is incredibly fast, and a top bloke too! His training consists of a greasy fry up and going out for a ride to enjoy himself… I can’t help but think what he would be like if incorporated high-tech cycling into his world – perhaps he would just give up due to the boredom of spending hundreds of hours riding a stationary bike though the winter.\r\n\r\nAttending races frequently, I still feel the hi-tech route is the way to go, but the danger is not knowing how to interpret the information, despite having over 20years of competitive riding experience (in fits and starts) – I’m still failing at this.

That’s just a bit of background – the new breed of cyclist, of which there seem to be millions is perhaps the subject of another post… I’ve always been a cyclist (apart from an eight year break straight after I attended training camp in Majorca [that’s just how sore I was!]), and like most of my peers – and I’ve always wanted anything that will make me go faster. Ever since BBC’s ‘Tomorrows World’ I’ve always been very interested about any kind of bleeding edge technology. I purchased a set of Tri-Bars the weekend after they were deemed legal by the CTT or RTTC as it was then. Cyclists are suckers for shiny new bits that bring promise of going faster than their competitors (this often includes their riding partners – if they have a competitive streak like myself).\r\n\r\nBack then only [sport] scientists with access to expensive monitoring equipment, but recently the cost of measuring equipment, specifically power meters (roughly speaking a device that measures the force applied to the pedals, and multiplies it by the angular velocity to arrive at a figure described in Watts)  has dropped to a price which falls within the budget of many amateur cyclists, and can be fitted to the bicycle itself rather than being restricted to the lab. \r\n\r\nSome may say I’m boring, but ever since college I’ve been interested in data – not just data, but how to build information from data. Data is (or ‘are’ if we are talking plural units) normally fairly meaningless to the naked eye, it’s how we format it that transforms it into useful information. Cycling is one of the few sports where we can gather so much useful data – the bicycle is an extremely efficient machine where many measurements can be taken in addition to the standard metrics such as heart rate which can be measured in many other endurance sports.  There are many desktop and web-based programs out there which allow the cyclist to view various metrics in a graphical format. These are highly useful for post race analysis, or monitoring training loads etc. Some have highly useable, convenient, social web-based interfaces but don’t show enough data (Strava), others have ugly interfaces with poor user experience, but are much better at showing performance trends (WKO+). The result is usually that rides have to be uploaded to several systems. \r\n\r\nBut the question is do any of systems help the average user? Top time triallist and author  Michael Hutchinson’s book Faster: The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World''s Fastest Cyclists  describes how the success of the British Cycling Team was partly founded on the use  technology – coaches using vast amounts of historical data to produce training plans for their athletes. This is where I think where the data recorded is particularly useful. It’s interpretation. \r\n\r\nI have been using a power meter for over 18 months now, in which time I have become slower and slower in my races. In 2012 my target was to go under the hour for a 25 Mile time trial, something I had spent the whole winter training for – using some rollers (basically a treadmill for a bike) trying to spin a bigger and bigger gear, and doing some MTB and club road rides. As I’d injured myself late 2011 season, I’d had to start gingerly, so had to rapidly gain fitness in time for the start of my racing season in March. It was all very unscientific, but the long and short of it was that by June, on a wet and windy day I managed to do a 59:32, achieving my target. Unfortunately, I have no idea what power I’d produced on that day as I didn’t take delivery of my first power meter until Jan 2013. With all the live monitoring and analysis that a power meter provides 2013 was a much slower year, I’d also read many books by respected authors on the subject too – late 2013 I’d decided to ignore all I’d read and go back to training by  feel, but using a power meter to measure for improvement.\r\n\r\n2014  began ok again but by May I seemed to be finishing well further back than I know I’m capable of – I’m only 2 Watts behind my best performance of 2013, but feeling a bit fed up. Recently at my local cycling club’s  (Minehead CC) first of the year’s hill climb series, We had a debate whether technology actually helps. One of the club’s members does not subscribe to the hi-tech route – rather than ‘All the gear, no idea’ it’s ‘None of the gear, definitely doing something right’, as he frequently rides much, much faster than his lycra’d up counterparts – I love to see this, unless, it is me he is overtaking of course! He is a farmer who admits to like eating greasy food, but for whatever reason, he is incredibly fast, and a top bloke too! His training consists of a greasy fry up and going out for a ride to enjoy himself… I can’t help but think what he would be like if incorporated high-tech cycling into his world – perhaps he would just give up due to the boredom of spending hundreds of hours riding a stationary bike though the winter.\r\n\r\nAttending races frequently, I still feel the hi-tech route is the way to go, but the danger is not knowing how to interpret the information, despite having over 20years of competitive riding experience (in fits and starts) – I’m still failing at this. I also feel training without any formal coaching is bad too – many top coaches insist that their athletes own and use a power meter. A self-coached athlete is a danger to themselves. Recently I’ve started to use TrainerRoad software which is like being coached in a way, but does not take into account individual strengths and weaknesses, but at least this formalised high tech training is guaranteed to bring improved results. \r\nMy take on it is that the cyclist should be able to look for patterns in their training and race data that lead up to their best performances, rather than relying on rule or algorithm based analysis. We’re going to be creating an online app that allows the user to do this. No details yet, but harnessing the power of HTML5 we’re going to be filling in the gaps left my other applications.

That’s just a bit of background – the new breed of cyclist, of which there seem to be millions is perhaps the subject of another post… I’ve always been a cyclist (apart from an eight year break straight after I attended training camp in Majorca [that’s just how sore I was!]), and like most of my peers – and I’ve always wanted anything that will make me go faster. Ever since BBC’s ‘Tomorrows World’ I’ve always been very interested about any kind of bleeding edge technology. I purchased a set of Tri-Bars the weekend after they were deemed legal by the CTT or RTTC as it was then. Cyclists are suckers for shiny new bits that bring promise of going faster than their competitors (this often includes their riding partners – if they have a competitive streak like myself).\r\n\r\nBack then only [sport] scientists with access to expensive monitoring equipment, but recently the cost of measuring equipment, specifically power meters (roughly speaking a device that measures the force applied to the pedals, and multiplies it by the angular velocity to arrive at a figure described in Watts)  has dropped to a price which falls within the budget of many amateur cyclists, and can be fitted to the bicycle itself rather than being restricted to the lab. \r\n\r\nSome may say I’m boring, but ever since college I’ve been interested in data – not just data, but how to build information from data. Data is (or ‘are’ if we are talking plural units) normally fairly meaningless to the naked eye, it’s how we format it that transforms it into useful information. Cycling is one of the few sports where we can gather so much useful data – the bicycle is an extremely efficient machine where many measurements can be taken in addition to the standard metrics such as heart rate which can be measured in many other endurance sports.  There are many desktop and web-based programs out there which allow the cyclist to view various metrics in a graphical format. These are highly useful for post race analysis, or monitoring training loads etc. Some have highly useable, convenient, social web-based interfaces but don’t show enough data (Strava), others have ugly interfaces with poor user experience, but are much better at showing performance trends (WKO+). The result is usually that rides have to be uploaded to several systems. \r\n\r\nBut the question is do any of systems help the average user? Top time triallist and author  Michael Hutchinson’s book Faster: The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World''s Fastest Cyclists  describes how the success of the British Cycling Team was partly founded on the use  technology – coaches using vast amounts of historical data to produce training plans for their athletes. This is where I think where the data recorded is particularly useful. It’s interpretation. I think the recent results on the track speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nI have been using a power meter for over 18 months now, in which time I have become slower and slower in my races. In 2012 my target was to go under the hour for a 25 Mile time trial, something I had spent the whole winter training for – using some rollers (basically a treadmill for a bike) trying to spin a bigger and bigger gear, and doing some MTB and club road rides. As I’d injured myself late 2011 season, I’d had to start gingerly, so had to rapidly gain fitness in time for the start of my racing season in March. It was all very unscientific, but the long and short of it was that by June, on a wet and windy day I managed to do a 59:32, achieving my target. Unfortunately, I have no idea what power I’d produced on that day as I didn’t take delivery of my first power meter until Jan 2013. With all the live monitoring and analysis that a power meter provides 2013 was a much slower year, I’d also read many books by respected authors on the subject too – late 2013 I’d decided to ignore all I’d read and go back to training by  feel, but using a power meter to measure for improvement.\r\n\r\n2014  began ok again but by May I seemed to be finishing well further back than I know I’m capable of – I’m only 2 Watts behind my best performance of 2013, but feeling a bit fed up. Recently at my local cycling club’s  (Minehead CC) first of the year’s hill climb series, We had a debate whether technology actually helps. One of the club’s members does not subscribe to the hi-tech route – rather than ‘All the gear, no idea’ it’s ‘None of the gear, definitely doing something right’, as he frequently rides much, much faster than his lycra’d up counterparts – I love to see this, unless, it is me he is overtaking of course! He is a farmer who admits to like eating greasy food, but for whatever reason, he is incredibly fast, and a top bloke too! His training consists of a greasy fry up and going out for a ride to enjoy himself… I can’t help but think what he would be like if incorporated high-tech cycling into his world – perhaps he would just give up due to the boredom of spending hundreds of hours riding a stationary bike though the winter.\r\n\r\nAttending races frequently, I still feel the hi-tech route is the way to go, but the danger is not knowing how to interpret the information, despite having over 20years of competitive riding experience (in fits and starts) – I’m still failing at this. I also feel training without any formal coaching is bad too – many top coaches insist that their athletes own and use a power meter. A self-coached athlete is a danger to themselves. Recently I’ve started to use TrainerRoad software which is like being coached in a way, but does not take into account individual strengths and weaknesses, but at least this formalised high tech training is guaranteed to bring improved results. \r\nMy take on it is that the cyclist should be able to look for patterns in their training and race data that lead up to their best performances, rather than relying on rule or algorithm based analysis. We’re going to be creating an online app that allows the user to do this. No details yet, but harnessing the power of HTML5 we’re going to be filling in the gaps left my other applications.

That’s just a bit of background – the new breed of cyclist, of which there seem to be millions is perhaps the subject of another post… I’ve always been a cyclist (apart from an eight year break straight after I attended training camp in Majorca [that’s just how sore I was!]), and like most of my peers – and I’ve always wanted anything that will make me go faster. Ever since BBC’s ‘Tomorrows World’ I’ve always been very interested about any kind of bleeding edge technology. I purchased a set of Tri-Bars the weekend after they were deemed legal by the CTT or RTTC as it was then. Cyclists are suckers for shiny new bits that bring promise of going faster than their competitors (this often includes their riding partners – if they have a competitive streak like myself).\r\n\r\nBack then only [sport] scientists with access to expensive monitoring equipment, but recently the cost of measuring equipment, specifically power meters (roughly speaking a device that measures the force applied to the pedals, and multiplies it by the angular velocity to arrive at a figure described in Watts)  has dropped to a price which falls within the budget of many amateur cyclists, and can be fitted to the bicycle itself rather than being restricted to the lab. \r\n\r\nSome may say I’m boring, but ever since college I’ve been interested in data – not just data, but how to build information from data. Data is (or ‘are’ if we are talking plural units) normally fairly meaningless to the naked eye, it’s how we format it that transforms it into useful information. Cycling is one of the few sports where we can gather so much useful data – the bicycle is an extremely efficient machine where many measurements can be taken in addition to the standard metrics such as heart rate which can be measured in many other endurance sports.  There are many desktop and web-based programs out there which allow the cyclist to view various metrics in a graphical format. These are highly useful for post race analysis, or monitoring training loads etc. Some have highly useable, convenient, social web-based interfaces but don’t show enough data (Strava), others have ugly interfaces with poor user experience, but are much better at showing performance trends (WKO+). The result is usually that rides have to be uploaded to several systems. \r\n\r\nBut the question is do any of systems help the average user? Top time triallist and author  Michael Hutchinson’s book Faster: The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World''s Fastest Cyclists  describes how the success of the British Cycling Team was partly founded on the use  technology – coaches using vast amounts of historical data to produce training plans for their athletes. This is where I think where the data recorded is particularly useful. It’s interpretation. I think the recent results on the track speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nI have been using a power meter for over 18 months now, in which time I have become slower and slower in my races. In 2012 my target was to go under the hour for a 25 Mile time trial, something I had spent the whole winter training for – using some rollers (basically a treadmill for a bike) trying to spin a bigger and bigger gear, and doing some MTB and club road rides. As I’d injured myself late 2011 season, I’d had to start gingerly, so had to rapidly gain fitness in time for the start of my racing season in March. It was all very unscientific, but the long and short of it was that by June, on a wet and windy day I managed to do a 59:32, achieving my target. Unfortunately, I have no idea what power I’d produced on that day as I didn’t take delivery of my first power meter until Jan 2013. With all the live monitoring and analysis that a power meter provides 2013 was a much slower year, I’d also read many books by respected authors on the subject too – late 2013 I’d decided to ignore all I’d read and go back to training by  feel, but using a power meter to measure for improvement.\r\n\r\n2014  began ok again but by May I seemed to be finishing well further back than I know I’m capable of – I’m only 2 Watts behind my best performance of 2013, but feeling a bit fed up. Recently at my local cycling club’s  (Minehead CC) first of the year’s hill climb series, We had a debate whether technology actually helps. One of the club’s members does not subscribe to the hi-tech route – rather than ‘All the gear, no idea’ it’s ‘None of the gear, definitely doing something right’, as he frequently rides much, much faster than his lycra’d up counterparts – I love to see this, unless, it is me he is overtaking of course! He is a farmer who admits to like eating greasy food, but for whatever reason, he is incredibly fast, and a top bloke too! His training consists of a greasy fry up and going out for a ride to enjoy himself… I can’t help but think what he would be like if incorporated high-tech cycling into his world – perhaps he would just give up due to the boredom of spending hundreds of hours riding a stationary bike though the winter.\r\n\r\nAttending races frequently, I still feel the hi-tech route is the way to go, but the danger is not knowing how to interpret the information, despite having over 20years of competitive riding experience (in fits and starts) – I’m still failing at this. I also feel training without any formal coaching is bad too – many top coaches insist that their athletes own and use a power meter. A self-coached athlete is a danger to themselves. Recently I’ve started to use TrainerRoad software which is like being coached in a way, but does not take into account individual strengths and weaknesses, but at least this formalised high tech training is guaranteed to bring improved results. \r\nMy take on it is that the cyclist should be able to look for patterns in their training and race data that lead up to their best performances, rather than relying on rule or algorithm based analysis. We’re going to be creating an online app that allows the user to do this. No details yet, but harnessing the power of HTML5 we’re going to be filling in the gaps left my other applications.
